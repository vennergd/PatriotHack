## Challenges:

### GDIT Challenge (Option 1): Contextual Search
Search for textual information that is semantically similar to other texts is a fundamental challenge in information retrieval. Many methods have been applied to convert unstructured text into structured information that can be searched, compared, and classified including:
•	Keyword Boolean (“high” AND ” seas”)
•	Expanded vocabulary (thesaurus, concepts)
•	Statistical (TF-IDF) 
•	NLP (semantic, entity, and event) 
•	Deep Learning trained word embeddings (Word2Vec, Stanford GloVE, etc.)
Recent improvements using Deep Learning trained word embeddings are demonstrating significant improvement over all previous methods. 

Our PatriotHack challenge is to select a large corpus of text from collections we have stored in the "data" folder, and use Deep Learning trained word embeddings that have contextual awareness of how a word is used in a sentence. Use this to create a “More Like This” search that can take a search string and return documents that are similar to that query. Demonstrate the use of the solution and discuss it’s applicability across various use cases.

### GDIT Challenge (Option 2): Image Classification
We are living in a golden age of AI, driven by Deep Learning successes built with open-source tools that include a rich array of network topologies, running on GPU-boosted compute, learning from very large corpus of labeled data.  The progenitor of this explosion was the ImageNet competition – which was revolutionized image detection, recognition, and classification solutions.

Our PatriotHack challenge is to locate at least two pre-trained image classification Deep Learning Networks – apply them to a corpus of images we have stored in the "images" folder – and compare their performance. Select the “best” performing network and use it against a second set of images we provide to classify images, e.g. “Images 1, 7, and 10 are Cats”, “Images 12, 32, and 99 are Trees”, etc. Demonstrate the use of the solution and discuss it’s applicability across various use cases.
